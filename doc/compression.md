# Update compression

### Do you need it?

You may be wondering if compression really makes sense. I have done some tests with popular apps.

These are apk installation files that you can download freely on the Internet.


|             | Uncompressed  | Compressed | Saving  |
| ----------- |-------------: | ---------: | ------: |
| GMail       | 26.0 MB       | 14.4 MB    | 44.6%   |
| Twitter     | 31.0 MB       | 20.2 MB    | 34.8%   |
| Wikipedia   | 10.1 MB       | 6.67 MB    | 33.9%   |
| YouTube     | 37.6 MB       | 28.6 MB    | 23.9%   |
| Netflix     | 27.2 MB       | 21.9 MB    | 19.4%   |
| Whatsapp    | 24.6 MB       | 20.7 MB    | 15.8%   |


Honestly, you won't find the file sizes from the left side in the Google Play Store.
The installation files stored there are also compressed and therefore more comparable to the right side of the table.
However, we do not have this luxury and therefore have to do the compression ourselves.
